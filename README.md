# Hi, I'm Akodu Sunmisola 👋

I'm a 400 level Mechatronics Engineering student at the Federal University of Agriculture, Abeokuta. I'm passionate about creating and learning things that combine hardware, software and intelligent systems. I'm currently exploring the worlds of IoT, robotics and Artificial Intelligence.

🌱 I'm currently learning and exploring
- Embedded systems and IoT (ESP32, Arduino, sensors, actuators)
- Python programming(Intermediate)
- AI and Machine Learning  for robotics and automation
- Circuit simulation and prototyping using Wokwi
- Graphic design and multimedia tools (Canva, Photoshop, Capcut)

🔭 Projects & Work
- Sensors and Actuators Training Kit – Simulated circuits using Wokwi and documented everything from design to testing.  
- ESP32 Multivibrator Circuit – Built a small embedded system with LEDs and a buzzer.  
- Ongoing Projects – Exploring AI/ML applications in robotics and embedded systems.

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on
- IoT projects that combine sensors, actuators, and automation  
- Small robotics systems and embedded projects  
- Python-based AI/ML projects for intelligent control  
- Educational tools or simulations that help others learn engineering concepts

⚡Fun Facts About Me
- I love blending creativity with engineering to solve problems.  
- I enjoy learning new tools and techniques, from video editing to web design.  
- I’m always looking for ways to make technology more interactive and intelligent.
